# Polygence
This repository contains my coding work for my Polygence project, which is to create a web interface for a deep learning-driven diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.<br />
The web application can be accessed [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/csanjay/DR_Predictor).<br />

You can run 'DRPredictor.ipynb' with various pretrained models other than VGG-19, which was used here.<br />
The 'app.py' file uses a Pickle file from the Jupyter notebook to deploy the model onto the web application linked above.

## Data Use Agreements
The data used for this project were provided in part by APTOS and EyePACS, accessed through Kaggle.
